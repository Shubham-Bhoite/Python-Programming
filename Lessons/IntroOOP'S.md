# Introduction to Object-oriented programming

## 1) Class:
-   A class is a blueprint or template for creating objects.
-   It defines the properties and methods that an object of that class.

## 2) Object:
-   An object is an instance of a class.
-   Object contains its own data and methods. 

## 3) Encapsulation:
-   It means internal state of an object is hidden and can only be accessed or modified through the object's methods.

## 4)  Inheritance:
-   It allows new classes to be created that inherit the properties and methods of an existing class. 
-   This allows for code reuse and makes it easy to create new classes that have similar functionality to existing classes.

## 5) Polymorphism:
-   It means that objects of different classes can be treated as if they were objects of a common class.
